### Components Description   
- [AUC](https://github.com/QianchaoLiu/MachineLearningTools/blob/master/Evaluation/auc.cpp) score evaluation (./Evaluation/auc.cpp)   
Implement of AUC based on [Wilcoxon-Mann-Witney Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test), which has a linear(O(n)) time complexity. BTW, AUC Score means the probability of any positve sample score is great than that of negative sample.
